# Holberton Fundations Notes

Notes to resume important concepts about software developer fundations.

## Getting Started

Each maing tecnology is stored in one directory.
Each directory contains several files with main subjects.
Each file contains titles with diferent subjects related.
Each subject has information contiguous (without) blank line, and some others
	related but no dependant of the previous one separated by a blank line.


### Prerequisites

Is very desirable to know something about:

```
Computer hardware
Basic math operations
Binary numbers
Windows environment
Internet navigation
Google search
```

### Installing

All files inside folders are plain text. In the root directory there are some
additional information files in other formats.

```
png, pdf, zip, jpg
```

## Running the tests

Test and codes explained are not complete, just show the importan concept for
every case and the reader most have the ability to use them inside a full code.


### Break down into end to end tests

Is very recomendable to always think in test cases, for example:

```
Is null, is empty, is 0, is infinite (to big), is diferent, is not available.
Diferent types, sizes
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
