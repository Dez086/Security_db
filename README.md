## Getting Started

Each maing tecnology is stored in one directory.
Each directory contains several files with main subjects.
Each file contains titles with diferent subjects related.
Each subject has information contiguous (without) blank line, and some others
	related but no dependant of the previous one separated by a blank line.

All files inside folders are plain text. In the root directory there are some
additional information files in other formats.
