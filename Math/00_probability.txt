Probability
P(A) = x(A)/Universe in [0, 1]

Independent events (A and B are independent).
    P(A and B) = P(A intersect B) = P(A) x P(B)   # Both occurring.

    Not mutually exclusive events
    P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)    # (inclusive)

Mutually exclusive events (disjointed)
    P(A and B) = P(A intersect B) = 0       # Both occurring.

    P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)

Conditional Probabilities (A and B are NOT independent)
P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B|A) = P(B) x P(A|B)
