CPython
reference implementation of Python, is a non-optimizing bytecode interpreter.

NumPy
www.numpy.org
pip install numpy
adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a
large collection of highlevel mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
Open source solutions that interoperate with NumPy include scipy.weave, numexpr
and Numba. Cython and Pythran are static-compiling alternatives to these. 

Matplotlib
matplotlib.org	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matplotlib
A plotting package that provides MATLAB-like plotting functionality
python3 -m pip install -U pip
python3 -m pip install -U matplotlib
[sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib]

Pandas
https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html


SciPy	vs MATLAB, GNU Octave, and Scilab. 
scipy.org/scipylib
adds more MATLAB-like functionality
NumPy + SciPy + Matplotlib + IPython + SymPy + pandas 


Anaconda

data science toolkit



pypy.org
PyPy often runs faster than CPython because PyPy is a just-in-time compiler while CPython is an interpreter.


https://cython.org/
Cython is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming language and the extended Cython programming language (based on Pyrex). It makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as Python itself.
https://pypi.org/project/Cython/	--> pip install Cython

http://pypy.org/
PyPy is a fast, compliant alternative implementation of the Python language
(2.7.13 and 3.6.9). It has several advantages and distinct features:
    Speed: thanks to its Just-in-Time compiler, Python programs often run faster on PyPy. (What is a JIT compiler?)
    “If you want your code to run faster, you should probably just use PyPy.” — Guido van Rossum (creator of Python)
    Memory usage: memory-hungry Python programs (several hundreds of MBs or more) might end up taking less space than they do in CPython.
    Compatibility: PyPy is highly compatible with existing python code. It supports cffi and can run popular python libraries like twisted and django.
    Stackless: PyPy comes by default with support for stackless mode, providing micro-threads for massive concurrency.
