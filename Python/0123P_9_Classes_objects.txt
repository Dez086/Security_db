********************** OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING ****************************
https://www.python-course.eu/python3_object_oriented_programming.php

Everything is a class: functions and methods are values just like lists,
integers or floats. Each of these are instances of their corresponding classes.

    Encapsulation
    Data Abstraction
    Polymorphism
    Inheritance



*******************************************************************************
                      9. Classes and objects
*******************************************************************************

Class				--> a template to create...
Objects/Instances	-->

Fields/Variables 	--> Attributes. Valid within context of...

	instance variables (are owned): belong to instance/object
		each object has its own copy of the field i.e. they are not shared 

	class variables (are shared): belong to the class itself
		can be accessed by all instances of that class
		Only one copy of the class variable, if one object change it, that 
		change will be seen by all the other instances.


Methods / Functions	--> Capabilities
	__self__	--> My ... Equivalente to 'this' in C and Java
					Reference to variables and methods of the same object.

Methods
Have at least one argument: method(self)
__ini__		is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated, created
		to do initialization, passing initial values to your object

Instead of Class_name.field	--> self.__class__.fiels
every object refers to its class via the self.__class__ attribute.

All class members are public (and virtual, note for c++, java)
EXCEPTION: double underscore prefix, __privatevar iS a private variable.
Convention: underscore prefix, is to be used only within the class or object

Class C, instance x of C, method m of C, the following are equivalent:
    type(x).m(x, ...)
    C.m(x, ...)
    x.m(...)

"""Descriptions of class or method."""		//use docstrings.
	class_name.__doc__ 			//access the class docstring at runtime
	class_name.method.__doc__	//access the method docstring
