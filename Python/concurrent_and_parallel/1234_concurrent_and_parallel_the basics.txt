CONCURRENCY is about DEALING with lots of things at once but
PARALLELISM is about DOING   lots of things at once.

general concurrent models
    Petri nets, process calculi, the parallel random-access machine model,
    the actor model and the Reo Coordination Language.

Program    ->    Process[es]    ->    Thread[s]
   1       ->       1...n       ->     1...n*m
   

Program: passive collection of instructions, e.g. stored in a file on disk
    The same program can have several processes running.
Process: instance of a program
    Executed by one or many threads.
    "process" (or task) is "something that takes up time", as opposed to
    "memory", which is "something that takes up space"
    Multitasking: method to allow multiple processes to share resources.
        Each CPU (core) executes a single task at a time.
        Appearance of many processes executing simultaneously (i.e. in parallel)
Thread: of execution: smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can
    be managed independently by a scheduler
    Single-threaded process:
    Multithreading model:
        Single processor: use time slicing, CPU switches between SW threads.
        Multiprocessor (multi-core): multiple threads execute in parallel, with
        every processor or core executing a separate thread simultaneously;
        SW threads can be executed concurrently by separate HW threads.
