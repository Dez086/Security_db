PID (i.e., process identification number) is automatically assigned to each process.

executing instance of a program. Unique PID, a non-negative integer.

The process init will always have PID 1. The default maximum PIDs is 32,767.

file pid_max, value is one greater than the maximum PID. Default of 32768,
but it can be set to any number up to approximately four million.
The maximum number of processes is only limited by the amount of physical memory (i.e., RAM) available.

COMMANDS

ps		// The PIDs for the processes currently on the system 
pstree 	// Shows the process names and PIDs in a tree diagram

top	// PIDs of currently running processes along with other information
		// it continuously updates the information.

pidof	// command provides the PID of a program whose name is passed to it as an argument (i.e., input).

kill 		// makes it possible to end a program that cannot otherwise be stopped except by rebooting
kill "$(pgrep -f "4-to_infinity_and_beyond")"

ls /proc | less		// current processes, kernel data that changes in real time.
					// There is a numbered directory in /proc corresponding to each PID 
cat /proc/1716/cmdline 	// name of the command (along with any options and arguments) that the process was started with
cat /proc/1/status		// More extensive information 

It will be necessary to use the root by using the su (i.e., substitute user) command, to read files in the /proc directory.

echo $$	// Display own PID
    $$ Expands to the process ID of the shell.
        In a () subshell, it expands to the process ID of the invoking shell, not the subshell.
    $BASHPID Expands to the process ID of the current Bash process.
        In a () subshell, it expands to the process ID of the subshell

pgrep, pkill - look up or signal processes based on name and other attributes
pgrep [options] pattern		// looks through the currently running processes and lists the process IDs
								// which match the selection criteria to stdout.
pkill [options] pattern		// pkill  will  send  the  specified  signal  (by default SIGTERM)
								// to each process instead of listing them on stdout.
When no signal is included in the pkill command-line syntax, the default signal that is used is –15 (SIGTERM). Using the –9 signal (SIGKILL) with the pkill command ensures that the process terminates promptly. However, the –9 signal should not be used to kill certain processes, such as a database process, or an LDAP server process. The result is that data might be lost.
