***************************** MACHINE LEARNING ********************************


***
The term artificial intelligence was coined in 1956, but AI has become more popular today thanks to increased data volumes, advanced algorithms, and improvements in computing power and storage.

Science of training machines to perform human tasks
Machine learning, method how machines learn from data, to train machines how to learn.
    life cycle: ask question, collect the data, train algorithm, try it out, collect feedback, use the feedback to improve algorithm

Artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks. Most AI examples that you hear about today – from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars – rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing. Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data.

Narrow (weak) IA, just perform one specific task.

How Artificial Intelligence Works

AI works by combining large amounts of data with fast, iterative processing and intelligent algorithms, allowing the software to learn automatically from patterns or features in the data. AI is a broad field of study that includes many theories, methods and technologies, as well as the following major subfields:

    Machine learning automates analytical model building. It uses methods from neural networks, statistics, operations research and physics to find hidden insights in data without explicitly being programmed for where to look or what to conclude.
    A neural network is a type of machine learning that is made up of interconnected units (like neurons) that processes information by responding to external inputs, relaying information between each unit. The process requires multiple passes at the data to find connections and derive meaning from undefined data.
    Deep learning uses huge neural networks with many layers of processing units, taking advantage of advances in computing power and improved training techniques to learn complex patterns in large amounts of data. Common applications include image and speech recognition.
    Cognitive computing is a subfield of AI that strives for a natural, human-like interaction with machines. Using AI and cognitive computing, the ultimate goal is for a machine to simulate human processes through the ability to interpret images and speech – and then speak coherently in response.  
    Computer vision relies on pattern recognition and deep learning to recognize what’s in a picture or video. When machines can process, analyze and understand images, they can capture images or videos in real time and interpret their surroundings.
    Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability of computers to analyze, understand and generate human language, including speech. The next stage of NLP is natural language interaction, which allows humans to communicate with computers using normal, everyday language to perform tasks.

Machine learning is a research field in computer science, artificial intelligence, and statistics. [1]
Is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Train algorithms to learn patterns and make predictions from data. “Training” involves feeding huge amounts of data to the algorithm and allowing the algorithm to adjust itself and improve.

While many machine learning algorithms have been around for a long time, the ability to automatically apply complex mathematical calculations to big data – over and over, faster and faster – is a recent development. Here are a few widely publicized examples of machine learning applications you may be familiar with:

    The heavily hyped, self-driving Google car? The essence of machine learning.
    Online recommendation offers such as those from Amazon and Netflix? Machine learning applications for everyday life.
    Knowing what customers are saying about you on Twitter? Machine learning combined with linguistic rule creation.
    Fraud detection? One of the more obvious, important uses in our world today.

Neural network was conceived of by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943. They wrote a seminal paper on how neurons may work and modeled their ideas by creating a simple neural network using electrical circuits.

This breakthrough model paved the way for neural network research in two areas:

Biological processes in the brain.
The application of neural networks to artificial intelligence (AI).

AI research quickly accelerated, with Kunihiko Fukushima developing the first true, multilayered neural network in 1975.

The original goal of the neural network approach was to create a computational system that could solve problems like a human brain. However, over time, researchers shifted their focus to using neural networks to match specific tasks, leading to deviations from a strictly biological approach. Since then, neural networks have supported diverse tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games, and medical diagnosis.

As structured and unstructured data sizes increased to big data levels, people developed deep learning systems, which are essentially neural networks with many layers. Deep learning enables the capture and mining of more and bigger data, including unstructured data.

Deep learning is one of many approaches to machine learning. Combines advances in computing power and special types of neural networks to learn complicated patterns in large amounts of data. Is a type of machine learning that trains a computer to perform human-like tasks, such as recognizing speech, identifying images or making predictions. Instead of organizing data to run through predefined equations, deep learning sets up basic parameters about the data and trains the computer to learn on its own by recognizing patterns using many layers of processing.

Data analysis (mining) investigate the structure of data and use it to identify patterns and possible solutions to problems. Within this domain, data science draws on methodologies from statistics, mathematics, and computer science to both analyze events using data and predict possible outcomes. One important trend within data science is machine learning, which uses algorithmic data inputs and statistical analysis to train computers to output values within a certain range. In this way, machine learning enables practices such as automated decision-making. [4]
