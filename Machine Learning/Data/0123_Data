							Data science
*******************************************************************************

Math + Programming + Domain field
Massive amount of data + High computational power

--> discover useful information
--> inform conclusions and supporting decision-making


Analysis
	Descriptive:	What has happened, Statistics, visualization, exploration
	Diagnostic:		Why happened
	Predictive:		what could happen
	Prescriptive:	What should we do. Avoid situation

PHASES:
	Business requirement:
		resources, targets

	Data extraction - Acquire data:
		Internal: RDBMS, SQL, flat files (CSV, JSON, XML)
		External: buy data, scrapping, social media, IoT, web, DBs, streaming
		Transport data (central location):
			collect data at one place
		DBA role:
			Ask permision for analysis, is ethical to use data?, are allowed?

	Data preprocessing:
		Standarization, [un]structured data, text/img/num/categories
		Data cleaning - correction:
			missing data, outlier in data (noise), empty data, non relevant,
			data imputaton, incorrect types, incorrect or invalid values
			statistical sanitization
		Data transformation
		Data in good quality but not suitable pass ML algorithm
		Data wrangling:
			hierarchival data, handling categorical data, reshaping structures
			indexing data, merging, combining an joining data.

	Exploratory analysis
		Statistical parameter of feature
		Correlation vs causation analysis
		Hypothesis testing
		Apply statistical technique: data quality
		Dataset imbalanced or not
		Data is sufficient or not
		Data visualization, representations, graphics

	Data action:
		Algorithm selection
			Approach: Machine learning / Rule based model / hybrid
			Learning:
				Supervised: regression, classification
				Unsupervised: clustering, anomaly detection
			Data:
				Unstructured: deep learning, CNN, RNN
				Structured: ML, regression, random forest/decision tree,SVM,XGBoost
		Model creation
		Machine learning researcher role
		Deploy model into production
		Building ETL pipelines
		Live dashboard and reporting
		Decision making and real-life test

CPython
reference implementation of Python, is a non-optimizing bytecode interpreter.

NumPy
www.numpy.org
pip install numpy
adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a
large collection of highlevel mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
Open source solutions that interoperate with NumPy include scipy.weave, numexpr
and Numba. Cython and Pythran are static-compiling alternatives to these. 

Matplotlib
matplotlib.org	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matplotlib
A plotting package that provides MATLAB-like plotting functionality
python3 -m pip install -U pip
python3 -m pip install -U matplotlib
[sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib]

Pandas
https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
pip install pandas
conda install pandas
https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html
	

SciPy	vs MATLAB, GNU Octave, and Scilab. 
scipy.org/scipylib
adds more MATLAB-like functionality
NumPy + SciPy + Matplotlib + IPython + SymPy + pandas 


Anaconda

data science toolkit



pypy.org
PyPy often runs faster than CPython because PyPy is a just-in-time compiler while CPython is an interpreter.


https://cython.org/
Cython is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming language and the extended Cython programming language (based on Pyrex). It makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as Python itself.
https://pypi.org/project/Cython/	--> pip install Cython

http://pypy.org/
PyPy is a fast, compliant alternative implementation of the Python language
(2.7.13 and 3.6.9). It has several advantages and distinct features:
    Speed: thanks to its Just-in-Time compiler, Python programs often run faster on PyPy. (What is a JIT compiler?)
    “If you want your code to run faster, you should probably just use PyPy.” — Guido van Rossum (creator of Python)
    Memory usage: memory-hungry Python programs (several hundreds of MBs or more) might end up taking less space than they do in CPython.
    Compatibility: PyPy is highly compatible with existing python code. It supports cffi and can run popular python libraries like twisted and django.
    Stackless: PyPy comes by default with support for stackless mode, providing micro-threads for massive concurrency.
