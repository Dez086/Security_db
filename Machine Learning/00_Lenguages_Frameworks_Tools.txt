pypy.org
PyPy is a fast, compliant alternative implementation of the Python language.
PyPy often runs faster than CPython because PyPy is a just-in-time compiler.
Stackless: PyPy comes by default with support for stackless mode,
providing micro-threads for massive concurrency.

cython.org
Cython is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming
language and the extended Cython programming language (based on Pyrex).
It makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as Python itself.
https://pypi.org/project/Cython/	--> pip install Cython

matplotlib.org
A plotting package that provides MATLAB-like plotting functionality
python3 -m pip install -U pip; python3 -m pip install -U matplotlib
[sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib]

Pandas
https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html
https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
pip install pandas  ^  conda install pandas

scipy.org/scipylib
SciPy   vs MATLAB, GNU Octave, and Scilab. 
adds more MATLAB-like functionality
NumPy + SciPy + Matplotlib + IPython + SymPy + pandas 

scikit-learn.org/stable
Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis. Built on NumPy, SciPy,
and matplotlib. Open source, commercially usable.

www.tensorflow.org
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and resources.
Library for numerical computation using data flow graphs.
Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges
represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them.
This flexible architecture lets you deploy computation to one or more CPUs or
GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device without rewriting code.
For visualizing, offers TensorBoard, suite of visualization tools.

keras.io
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of
running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on
enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the
least possible delay is key to doing good research.

pytorch.org
An open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from
research prototyping to production deployment.
PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features:
    Tensor computation (like numpy) with strong GPU acceleration
    Deep Neural Networks built on a tape-based autograd system

https://www.anaconda.com/
Data science toolkit

numba
Just-in-time compiler for NumPy arrays, functions, and loops.
https://dask.org/   # advanced parallelism, enabling performance at scale.

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
www.rust-lang.org/
flutter.dev     Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled
applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
