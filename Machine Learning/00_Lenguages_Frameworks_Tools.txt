pypy.org
PyPy is a fast, compliant alternative implementation of the Python language.
PyPy often runs faster than CPython because PyPy is a just-in-time compiler.
Stackless: PyPy comes by default with support for stackless mode,
providing micro-threads for massive concurrency.

cython.org
Cython is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming
language and the extended Cython programming language (based on Pyrex).
It makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as Python itself.
https://pypi.org/project/Cython/	--> pip install Cython

matplotlib.org
A plotting package that provides MATLAB-like plotting functionality
python3 -m pip install -U pip; python3 -m pip install -U matplotlib
[sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib]

Pandas
https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html
https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
pip install pandas  ^  conda install pandas

scipy.org/scipylib
SciPy   vs MATLAB, GNU Octave, and Scilab. 
adds more MATLAB-like functionality
NumPy + SciPy + Matplotlib + IPython + SymPy + pandas 

https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis. Built on NumPy, SciPy,
and matplotlib. Open source, commercially usable.

https://www.tensorflow.org/
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and resources.

https://pytorch.org/
An open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from
research prototyping to production deployment.

https://keras.io/
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of
running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on
enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the
least possible delay is key to doing good research.

https://www.anaconda.com/
Data science toolkit

numba
Just-in-time compiler for NumPy arrays, functions, and loops.
https://dask.org/   # advanced parallelism, enabling performance at scale.


R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
www.rust-lang.org/
flutter.dev     Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled
applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
