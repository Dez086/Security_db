***************************** MACHINE LEARNING ********************************
Learning methods: supervised, unsupervised

Approaches: statistics, correlation, regresion
    k-nearest neighbor:
    Decision Tree Learning: (map observations about data to conclusions about
        the dataâ€™s target value, to create a model that will predict the value
        of a target based on input variables).
    Deep Learning: neural networks. supervised and serve to classify data, or
        unsupervised and perform pattern analysis.
