https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis Accessible to everybody, and reusable in various contexts Built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib Open source, commercially usable - BSD license

https://www.tensorflow.org/
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.

https://pytorch.org/
An open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment.

https://keras.io/
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

***************************** MACHINE LEARNING ********************************

***
Machine learning is a research field in computer science, artificial intelligence, and statistics. [1]

Train algorithms to learn patterns and make predictions from data.
It lets us use computers to automate decision-making processes.
Apps Netflix and Amazon, Banks, healthcare companies. 

***
Data analysis investigate the structure of data and use it to identify patterns and possible solutions to problems. Within this domain, data science draws on methodologies from statistics, mathematics, and computer science to both analyze events using data and predict possible outcomes. One important trend within data science is machine learning, which uses algorithmic data inputs and statistical analysis to train computers to output values within a certain range. In this way, machine learning enables practices such as automated decision-making. [4]

Learning methods: supervised, unsupervised

Approaches: statistics, correlation, regresion
    k-nearest neighbor:
    Decision Tree Learning: (map observations about data to conclusions about
        the dataâ€™s target value, to create a model that will predict the value
        of a target based on input variables).
    Deep Learning: neural networks. supervised and serve to classify data, or
        unsupervised and perform pattern analysis. 

Lenguages (python, Java, R, C++)
    Python  Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
            scikit-learn ML library, built on top NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
    Java, enterprise level for network security.
            ML libraries Deeplearning4j, MALLET, Weka
    R, statistical computing. Acadamia and has risen in industrial aplications
            Packages  caret, randomForest, e1071.
    C++, ML and IA in game and robot applications
            Libraries:  mlpack, Dlib, Shark.

    Julia?? Rush? Haskell, and Ruby.

Human Biases --> data, algorithms, programs with human-like biases, including business. So diverse people working, testing, reviewing is a need.
