I learned a lot by writing simple statements in C and looking via GDB or Radare2 at the disassembly. Assign an array to memory, see how it looks in assembly. Index that array at one point, see how that looks in assembly. Run a for() loop thru the array, see how that looks in assembly. This is the path to solving the hard crackme.
