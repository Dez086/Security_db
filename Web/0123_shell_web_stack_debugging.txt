Web stack debugging

Debugging usually takes a big chunk of a software engineer’s time.
The art of debugging… experience.

Simulate the flow by starting a Docker container with the distribution that is
specified in the requirements and by running your code.
Test and verify your assumptions

if you installed a web server and it isn’t serving a page when browsing the IP

	Is the web server started?
		You can check using the service manager
		also double check by checking process list.
	On what port should it listen?
		Check your web server configuration
	Is it actually listening on this port?
		netstat -lpdn - run as root or sudo so that you can see the process
		for each listening port
	It is listening on the correct server IP?
		netstat is also your friend here
	Is there a firewall enabled?
	Have you looked at logs?
		usually in /var/log and tail -f is your friend
	Can I connect to the HTTP port from the location I am browsing from?
		curl is your friend

Connect to a server/machine/computer/container, then:

	lsb_release -a
	ps auxff | grep ngin[x]
	nc -z 0 8080 ; echo $?
	netstat -na | grep ':80.*LISTEN'
	less /etc/services

	w
    	shows server uptime (continuously running)
		shows which users ARE connected to the server (IN THIS MOMENT)
		load average will give you a good sense of the server health
		https://scoutapm.com/blog/understanding-load-averages
		http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2017-08-08/linux-load-averages.html

	history
		commands previously run by the curren user

	top
		shows what is currently running on this server

	df
		shows disk utilization

netstat [-lpn]
    what port and IP your server is listening on, processes are using sockets


Machine
	df				Does the server have free disk space?
	w, top, ps		Is the server able to keep up with CPU load?
	free			Does the server have available memory?
	htop			Are the server disk(s) able to keep up with read/write IO?
	strace

There are often 3 ways of solving the issue:
	free up resources (stop process(es) or reduce their resource consumption)
    increase the machine resources (adding memory, CPU, disk space…)
    distributing the resource usage to other machines

Network issue
	ifconfig
		Expected network interfaces and IPs up and running?
    netstat -lpd
	netstat -lpn
		Listening on the sockets that it is supposed to? netstat
	telnet 8.8.8.8 80
		Can you connect from the location you want to connect from,
		to the socket you want to connect to?
	iptables -L
	sudo ufw status
		Does the server have the correct firewall rules?
        

Process issue
	If Software isn’t behaving as expected:
    Is the software started? init, init.d:
        service NAME_OF_THE_SERVICE status
        /etc/init.d/NAME_OF_THE_SERVICE status
    Is the software process running? pgrep, ps:
        pgrep -lf NAME_OF_THE_PROCESS
        ps auxf
    Is there anything interesting in the logs?
		look for log files in /var/log/ and tail -f is your friend

Always...
    Re-start server (and Check console for Error Messages)!!!
    Re-start your browser!!!
    Refresh browser: Cntl-F5 to get a fresh copy (instead of F5, cache).
    Check your spelling! Always assume case-sensitive.
	Don't type, copy and paste if possible!
	Find the ERROR MESSAGE!!! 

curl
	-vvv will print all headers and transfer state of a request/response
	-o redirect the response body of a request to a file
	-H will set your parameter in the Header part.
	-X define which HTTP:
		-X GET: to do a GET request (by default)
		-X POST: to do a POST request
		-X PUT: to do a PUT request
		-X DELETE: to do a DELETE request

# Size of the body of the response
curl --silent --head "$1" | grep Content-Length | awk '{print $2;}'

# Body of the response in case of redirections
curl --silent --location "$1"

# Sends a DELETE request and displays the body of the response
curl --silent --request DELETE "$1"

# All HTTP methods the server will accept.
curl --silent --head "$1" | grep Allow | cut --delimiter ' ' -f 2-

# script that takes in a URL as an argument, sends a GET request to the URL, and displays the body of the response
curl --silent --header "X-HolbertonSchool-User-Id:98" "$1"

# script that takes in a URL, sends a POST request to the passed URL, and displays the body of the response
curl --silent --request POST --data 'email=hr@holbertonschool.com&subject=I will always be here for PLD' "$1"

# script that sends a request to a URL passed as an argument, and displays only the status code of the response.
curl --output /dev/null --silent --write-out "%{http_code}" "$1"

# script that sends a JSON POST request to a URL passed as the first argument, and displays the body of the response.
curl --silent --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data @"$2" "$1"


	All query string parameters can be directly add to the URL.
	But for other HTTP method, you should use the attribute -d.
	You can use only one and it should be url encoded
		(separated by the symbol &) or multiples.
	By default, the Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
curl "http://localhost:5555/states" -X POST -d "name=Cali&code=VC"
curl "http://localhost:5555/states/12" -X PUT -d "name=Cali" -d "code=CAF"
curl "http://localhost:5555/states" -X POST
	-H "Content-Type: application/json"
	-d "{ \"name\": \"California\", \"code\": \"CA\" }"

	curl --output /dev/null --silent --write-out "%{http_code}\n" 0.0.0.0:5000
	curl --output /dev/null --silent --write-out "%{time_connect}\n" 0.0.0.0:5000
	curl --output /dev/null --silent --write-out "%{url_effective}\n" 0.0.0.0:5000
	curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST \
		--data '{"username":"xyz","password":"xyz"}' 0.0.0.0:5000/route_json 
	curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
		--request POST --data @"$2" "$1"				//@ to read from a file

curl --silent 0.0.0.0:5000/catch_me --location --request PUT --data 'user_id=98' --header "Origin:HolbertonSchool"

How to check if port is in use in

To check the listening ports and applications on Linux:

    Open a terminal application i.e. shell prompt.
    Run any one of the following command on Linux to see open ports:
    sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
    sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN
    sudo lsof -i:22 ## see a specific port such as 22 ##
    sudo nmap -sTU -O IP-address-Here
    For the latest version of Linux use the ss command. For example, ss -tulw

Let us see commands and its output in details.
Option #1: lsof command

The syntax is:
$ sudo lsof -i -P -n
$ sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
$ doas lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN ### [OpenBSD] ###

Sample outputs:
Fig.01: Check the listening ports and applications with lsof command
Fig.01: Check the listening ports and applications with lsof command

Consider the last line from above outputs:

sshd    85379     root    3u  IPv4 0xffff80000039e000      0t0  TCP 10.86.128.138:22 (LISTEN)

    sshd is the name of the application.
    10.86.128.138 is the IP address to which sshd application bind to (LISTEN)
    22 is the TCP port that is being used (LISTEN)
    85379 is the process ID of the sshd process

Option #2: netstat command

You can check the listening ports and applications with netstat as follows.
Linux netstat syntax

Run netstat command along with grep command to filter out port in LISTEN state:
$ netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN

The netstat command deprecated for some time on Linux. Therefore, you need to use the ss command as follows:
sudo ss -tulw
sudo ss -tulwn

Linux check if port is in use using ss command
Where ss command options are as follows:

    -t : Show only TCP sockets on Linux
    -u : Display only UDP sockets on Linux
    -l : Show listening sockets. For example, TCP port 22 is opened by SSHD server.
    -p : List process name that opened sockets
    -n : Don’t resolve service names i.e. don’t use DNS

FreeBSD/MacOS X netstat syntax

$ netstat -anp tcp | grep LISTEN
$ netstat -anp udp | grep LISTEN
OpenBSD netstat syntax

$ netstat -na -f inet | grep LISTEN
$ netstat -nat | grep LISTEN
Option #3: nmap command

The syntax is:
$ sudo nmap -sT -O localhost
$ sudo nmap -sU -O 192.168.2.13 ##[ list open UDP ports ]##
$ sudo nmap -sT -O 192.168.2.13 ##[ list open TCP ports ]##

Sample outputs:
Fig.02: Determines which ports are listening for TCP connections using nmap
Fig.02: Determines which ports are listening for TCP connections using nmap

You can combine TCP/UDP scan in a single command:
$ sudo nmap -sTU -O 192.168.2.13

A note about Windows users

You can check port usage from Windows operating system using following command:
netstat -bano | more
netstat -bano | grep LISTENING
netstat -bano | findstr /R /C:"[LISTEING]"
Conclusion

This page explained command to determining if a port is in use on Linux or Unix-like server. For more information see the nmap command and lsof command page online here
