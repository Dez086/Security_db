1. Key-value: Redis, Memcash
    Like python dictionary
    redis> SET user:23:bio "i like redis"
    redis> GET user:23:bio
    All in memory --> FAST, LIMITED SPACE, NO QUERIES
    For caching, pub/sub, leaderboards, real-time delivery, on top of other db

2. Wide column: cassandra, habase
    row key - several columns
    SCHEMA-LESS, NO RELATIONAL, NO JOINS
    For time-series, historical records, high-write, low-read

3- Document: MongoDB, Firestore, DynamoDB
    Collection | Documents (container for ke-value pairs, i.e.: JSON)
    For apps, games, iot, content management, NO FOR GRAPHS, DONT HAVE JOINS

4- Relational: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL server
    Joins, primary keys, foreing keys (reference date in a different table)
    Schema required, are ACID complient
    For most apps, NOT for unstructured data.

5- Graph: neo4j, dgraph
    Nodes (data) connected by edges (relationships)
    For graphs, knowledge graphs, recommendation engines,
    alternative to a lot of joins, use CYPHER

6- Search: elactic search, meilisearch
    For search engines, typeahead seach box

7- Multi-model: FaunaDB
    Graphql schema --> Select the best: document, relational, graph db type.

Others: data warehouse db, time-series db
